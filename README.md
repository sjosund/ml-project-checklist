# Machine Learning Project Checklist
The items on this checklist come from various sources, such as <a href="https://www.deeplearning.ai/machine-learning-yearning/"> Machine Learning Yearning</a>, <a href="https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/">Full Stack Deep Learning</a>, <a href="https://mlpowered.com/book/"> Building Machine Learning Powered Applications</a>, and also from my own personal experience. This is work in progress, and contributions are welcome. If you have any additions, please submit a PR to <a href="https://github.com/sjosund/ml-project-checklist">this repo</a>.

## Before modelling
### Project
- [ ] The project has a clear, codified business goal/metric
- [ ] There is a team who is ultimately responsible for the success/failure of the project
- [ ] We have a plan for how to reach a first deployed end product as fast as possible
- [ ] We have decided on how and when to keep the team in sync (daily/weekly standups, retrospectives, planning meetings, etc)
- [ ] We have assessed how the product will impact stakeholders (e.g. people, society, world)
- [ ] We have identified relevant regulation and translated it to requirements
- [ ] We have identified requirements related to fairness, accountability, and transparency

### Problem understanding
- [ ] We have decided on one single metric on which to rank our models
- [ ] We have clarified the costs of the different kinds of erroneous predictions
- [ ] We have an understanding of how good performance is "good enough"
- [ ] We know the constraints in serving time w.r.t. memory usage
- [ ] We know the constraints in serving time w.r.t. latency
- [ ] We know the constraints in serving time w.r.t. throughput
- [ ] We know if we’re doing streaming- or batch prediction
- [ ] We understand the current state of ML applied to the problem we’re trying to solve
- [ ] We have an idea of how important freshness is. How often will we need to change the model?
- [ ] We have domain experts who can help us understand the problem and error modes
- [ ] We know where the model will be deployed (server / client, browser / on device)

### Data
- [ ] We have selected a dev- and test set that are reflective of the real task we're trying to solve
- [ ] Our dev- and test sets are from the same distribution
- [ ] Our dev set is large enough, so that we can detect improvements to the desired accuracy
- [ ] We understand how to split the data into train/val/test to avoid data leakage
- [ ] If we need to collect data, we know how difficult and costly it will be to collect and annotate
- [ ] We have a plan for how to store and version our data, dataset splits, models, and change in annotations
- [ ] We get a reasonable <a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/aad9f93b86b7addfea4c419b9100c6cdd26cacea.pdf">“ML Test Score”</a>, table 1

## Modelling
- [ ] We have one or several well thought out baselines in place. These are not good enough, so there’s an actual need to use ML
- [ ] There’s a metrics webpage where we can compare runs and the url is ___________________
- [ ] We can (approximately) reproduce a model if needed
- [ ] We get a reasonable <a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/aad9f93b86b7addfea4c419b9100c6cdd26cacea.pdf">“ML Test Score”</a>, table 2

## Deployment
- [ ] We have CI in place
- [ ] We have tests for the full training pipeline
- [ ] We have validation tests
- [ ] We have functionality tests
- [ ] We have unit tests
- [ ] We have CD in place
- [ ] We have CT in place
- [ ] Blue/green deployment in place
- [ ] We can deploy a model in shadow mode
- [ ] Monitoring in place for memory consumption
- [ ] Monitoring in place for CPU consumption
- [ ] Monitoring in place for latency
- [ ] Monitoring in place for downtime
- [ ] Monitoring in place for requests per second
- [ ] Monitoring in place for prediction confidence over time
- [ ] We have a way of detecting if a model will fail on a given datapoint, and a corresponding fallback
- [ ] We get a reasonable <a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/aad9f93b86b7addfea4c419b9100c6cdd26cacea.pdf">“ML Test Score”</a>, table 3-4
